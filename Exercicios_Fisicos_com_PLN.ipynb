        "Este **PROJETO PRÁTICO** foi feito utilizando o Framework LangChain em conjunto com o LLM Gpt-4o-mini. Para escolher uma base de dados e realizar o import com mais facilidade, utilizamos a API do Kaggle. O tema do projeto envolve a prática de exercícios físicos, contendo uma base de dados que cita diversos exercícios de academia, como se preparar para iniciar o movimento, como deve ser feita a execução, quais são os músculos-alvo ao realizar o movimento e entre outros dados. O objetivo foi utilizar as informações de preparação e execução do movimento para aplicar a técnica de Sumarização de Textos, garantindo um resumo conciso e a Extração de Palavras-Chave, com intuito de identificar os músculos-alvo de cada exercício, além de uma terceira técnica adicional por meio de um Sistema de Sugestões de Exercícios (Perguntas e Respostas), no qual você digita um músculo que deseja exercitar e o modelo consegue indentificar quais exercícios são mais assertivos."
